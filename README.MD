The task is based on a sample scenario using Yeungnam Universityâ€™s website data, where you are expected to:

Build a simple chatbot system that can answer user questions.

Implement a basic LLM + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using the website content as a knowledge base.

Provide both the source code and a short explanation (how you approached the problem, tools/libraries used, and results).


You can use Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, or any other framework you are comfortable with.
The goal is not a perfect product, but to evaluate your problem-solving, coding, and AI implementation skills.

Deadline : Sunday (evening)
